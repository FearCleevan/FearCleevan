    <h3>Atchara</h3>
    <p>Atchara is an appetizer made from pickled green papaya. Julienned or grated green papaya are placed in airtight containers and soaked for a week in cooked vinegar and sugar mixture with onions, garlic, ginger, pepper corn, and red bell pepper.</p>
    <p>This is probably the most famous appetizer in the Philippines because every region seems to have their own version. This sweet and sour tasting appetizer is usually served with fried dishes such as fried tapa, longganisa, tocino, and even lechon manok. In addition, this can also give life to dull dishes.</p>

            <li>Heat the saucepan and pour-in the vinegar and bring to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>Add the sugar and 1 1/2 tsp salt then stir until well diluted
            </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and allow the syrup to cool down until temperature is low enough to handle.
            </li>
            <li>Place the combined vegetables and spices in a sterilized airtight jar and pour-in the syrup
            </li>
            <li>Seal the jar and place inside the refrigerator for a week (or 5 days minimum to achieve the expected texture and flavor).
