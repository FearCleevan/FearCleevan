    <p><strong>Bibingka</strong> is a type of rice cake native to the Philippines. It goes without saying that we Filipinos love rice. We have it with almost every meal, and dessert is no exception. This is why kakanin has become such a popular Filipino merienda. A combination of the words kanin (rice) and kain (eat), kakanin refers to a group of glutinous rice cakes Filipinos know and love.</p>

        <h3>Here are just some of my other recipes that put a twist on the popular treat:</h3>
        <p>If you're more of a biko or suman fan, perhaps this bibingkang malagkit recipe will be more to your liking. Personally, I think this recipe is more of a modified biko. Its sticky texture may be difficult to work with at first, but you'll end up with a delicious treat in the end.</p>
        <p>Royal bibingka is a type of bibingka from the Ilocos region. This one tastes a little bit more like a mix between cassava cake and espasol. Still, its chewy texture and sweet taste pairs great with a hot cup of coffee or cocoa.</p>
        <p>And if you want the original bibingka but in more bite-sized goodness? My bibingka muffin recipe gives you all the tastiness bibingka has to offer, but in cupcake sizes.</p>
